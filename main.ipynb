        "fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\n",

        "pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\n",
        "fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\n",
        "first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\n",

        "rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\n",
        "centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\n",
        "the whole front of the box-seat--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked his big\n",
        "whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\n",
        "our journey.\n",

        "I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\n",

        "languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\n",

        "losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\n",
        "straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\n",
        "hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\n",
        "seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\n",
        "what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\n",
        "time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\n",
        "excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\n",
        "snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\n",
        "the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\n",
        "in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\n",

        "them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\n",
        "deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\n",
        "grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\n",
        "pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\n",
        "the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\n",
        "mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\n",
        "the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\n",
        "we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\n",
        "peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\n",

        "\n",
        "As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\n",
        "us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\n",
        "emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\n",
        "sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\n",
        "we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\n",
        "that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\n",
        "and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\n",
        "was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\n",
        "turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\n",
        "devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\n",
        "many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\n",
        "and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\n",
        "shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\n",
        "again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its\n",
        "long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\n",
        "road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\n",
        "peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\n",
        "coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\n",
        "staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\n",
        "and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\n",
        "gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\n",
        "ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\n",
        "Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\n",
        "late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\n",
        "that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\n",
        "greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\n",
        "peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\n",
        "grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\n",
        "threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\n",
        "Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\n",
        "hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could\n",
        "only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\n",
        "but the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not\n",
        "walk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he\n",
        "evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\n",
        "approving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters\n",
        "before you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment's\n",
        "pause to light his lamps.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\n",
        "passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\n",
        "though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\n",
        "with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\n",
        "to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\n",
        "patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\n",
        "hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\n",
        "rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\n",
        "stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\n",
        "to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\n",
        "side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\n",
        "by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\n",
        "upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\n",
        "certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\n",
        "faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\n",
        "fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\n",
        "Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\n",
        "Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\n",
        "passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\n",
        "darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\n",
        "happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\n",
        "give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\n",
        "some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\n",
        "the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\n",
        "air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\n",
        "mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\n",
        "into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\n",
        "which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\n",
        "glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\n",
        "was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\n",
        "hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\n",
        "road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\n",
        "The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\n",
        "my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\n",
        "the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\n",
        "could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\n",
        "thought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said\n",
        "in German worse than my own:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\n",
        "now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\n",
        "the next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\n",
        "snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\n",
        "amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\n",
        "of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\n",
        "us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\n",
        "lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\n",
        "splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\n",
        "beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\n",
        "could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\n",
        "in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\n",
        "deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he\n",
        "spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\n",
        "very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\n",
        "companions whispered to another the line from Burger's \"Lenore\":--\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--\n",
        "    (\"For the dead travel fast.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\n",
        "gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\n",
        "putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr's\n",
        "luggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\n",
        "handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\n",
        "coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\n",
        "hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\n",
        "prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\n",
        "swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\n",
        "from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\n",
        "against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\n",
        "the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\n",
        "on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\n",
        "strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\n",
        "over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\n",
        "excellent German:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\n",
        "care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\n",
        "country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take\n",
        "any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\n",
        "little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\n",
        "any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\n",
        "unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\n",
        "then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\n",
        "seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\n",
        "again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\n",
        "so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\n",
        "I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\n",
        "protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\n",
        "delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\n",
        "passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\n",
        "within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\n",
        "suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\n",
        "recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\n",
        "long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\n",
        "another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\n",
        "now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\n",
        "to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\n",
        "it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\n",
        "strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\n",
        "quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\n",
        "sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\n",
        "side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\n",
        "affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\n",
        "jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\n",
        "madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\n",
        "from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\n",
        "the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\n",
        "to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\n",
        "whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\n",
        "doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\n",
        "quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\n",
        "took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\n",
        "time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\n",
        "narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\n",
        "\n",
        "Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\n",
        "roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\n",
        "rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\n",
        "could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\n",
        "rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\n",
        "It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\n",
        "so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\n",
        "keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\n",
        "fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\n",
        "and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\n",
        "grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\n",
        "however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\n",
        "left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\n",
        "driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\n",
        "jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\n",
        "what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\n",
        "I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\n",
        "his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\n",
        "and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\n",
        "endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\n",
        "Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\n",
        "around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where\n",
        "the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\n",
        "to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\n",
        "formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\n",
        "effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\n",
        "for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\n",
        "as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\n",
        "straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\n",
        "flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\n",
        "wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\n",
        "\n",
        "At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\n",
        "had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\n",
        "than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\n",
        "for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\n",
        "then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\n",
        "jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\n",
        "around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\n",
        "with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\n",
        "terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\n",
        "For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\n",
        "feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\n",
        "their true import.\n",
        "\n",
        "All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\n",
        "some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\n",
        "looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\n",
        "but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\n",
        "had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\n",
        "it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\n",
        "ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\n",
        "calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\n",
        "to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\n",
        "not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\n",
        "looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\n",
        "long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\n",
        "fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\n",
        "the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the\n",
        "wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\n",
        "dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\n",
        "seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\n",
        "darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\n",
        "ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\n",
        "always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\n",
        "driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\n",
        "vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\n",
        "and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\n",

        "When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\n",

        "strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\n",

        "them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\n",
        "studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\n",

        "massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\n",

        "\n",

        "light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\n",

        "of long disuse, and the great door swung back.\n",

        "of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\n",
        "lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\n",
        "throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\n",
        "open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\n",
        "gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He made no\n",
        "motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\n",
        "gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\n",
        "I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\n",
        "holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\n",
        "an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\n",
        "ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\n",
        "happiness you bring!\" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\n",
        "that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\n",
        "for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\n",

        "\"Count Dracula?\" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\n",

        "\"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\n",
        "the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\" As he was\n",
        "speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\n",
        "took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\n",
        "available. Let me see to your comfort myself.\" He insisted on carrying\n",
        "my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\n",
        "along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\n",
        "heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\n",
        "to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\n",
        "and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\n",

        "\n",

        "through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\n",
        "welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\n",
        "another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\n",
        "fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\n",
        "left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\n",
        "door:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\n",
